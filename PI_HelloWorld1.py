This plugin implements the canonical first program.  In this case, we will
create a window that has the text hello-world in it.  As an added bonus
the  text will change to 'This is a plugin' while the mouse is held down
in the window.

This plugin demonstrates creating a window and writing mouse and drawing
callbacks for that window.
